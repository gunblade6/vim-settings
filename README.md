# vim-settings

neovim `init.vim` file and can also work as `.vimrc` file

those are my prefered settings so if i use another pc oneday they will be there for me

`init.vim` file contains all the scripts and plugins

it should be in the `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` location for neovim to load it
with the nerd for (cascadia nerd) to read the file icons right
